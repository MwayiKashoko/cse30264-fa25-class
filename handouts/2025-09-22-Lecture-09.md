# Lecture 9 - UDP

## Overview

In Lecture 8, we did a deep dive on socket programming, specifically going through the system calls for socket programming.  In this lecture, we will walk through the two examples from Beej's Guide to Network Programming, finish up our examination of the streaming client and server examples.  We will briefly examine C++ as inspiration for a instance of a socket helper (see the class repo) and then will explore UDP, examining how it differs from TCP and why we might want to use it including a look at QUIC which is used for HTTP/3.

## Readings - Lecture 9

## Handouts

* This Overview
* Beej's Streaming Server / Client (last lecture)
* SocketHelper.cc (see class repo)

## Problem - In-Class

* Suppose we have the following settings
   * MSS = 1k, RTT = 50 ms, CWND_init = 1, SS_Thresh = 16
   * Link Speed = 1.25 Mb/s
   * Transfer data of 50 KB

## Key Points - In-Class - Lecture 9

* What is UDP?
* What is QUIC?
* When is it best to use TCP versus UDP?
