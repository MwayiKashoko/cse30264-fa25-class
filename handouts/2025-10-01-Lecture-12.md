# Lecture 12 - Data Plane (continued)

## Overview

In the last lecture, we went through an overview of the second part of the coding project and began review questions for the mid-term exam.  We continued with the data plane walking through subnets and discussed data forwarding, particularly the IPv4 and IPv6 headers.  In today's lecture, we will discuss UDP socket programming for the course project, subnets, NAT, DHCP, and possibly Software Defind Networking (SDN).  If time allows, we will then begin our pivot to the control plane.

## Readings

## Key Points

* UDP
   * How do you program with sockets for UDP?
* Data Plane
   * What is a subnet?
   * What is NAT? Why does it make our life hard?
   * What is DHCP? What is the v6 equivalent?
   * What is SDN? What makes it “different”?

## Looking Ahead
