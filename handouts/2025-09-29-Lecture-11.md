# Lecture 11 - Data Plane - Part 2

## Overview

Last lecture, we pivoted to look at the network layer and focus on the data plane, namely how packets are forwarded across the network.  We will continue working through the data plane and look at the nuance of forwarding, covering the various base headers for IPv4 and IPv6, NAT, DHCP. As time allows, we will discuss SDN (Software Defined Networking).  

## Readings - Lecture 11

* Chapter 4 - Kurose / Ross - Data Plane

## Handouts

* This Overview

## Mid-Term Review Question

If all of the flows in the network are TCP friendly, does that mean that the network is likely to be fair? Why or why not?

## Key Points - In-Class - Lecture 11

* Compare / contrast: FIFO, priority queueing, WFQ
* What is the difference between forwarding versus routing?
* What is the data plane versus the control plane?
* Compare / contrast: IPv4 vs. IPv6
* What is a FIB?
* What is fragmentation / why does it occur?
* What is a subnet?
* What is NAT? Why does it make our life hard?
* What is DHCP? What is the v6 equivalent?
* What is SDN? What makes it “different”?

## Looking Ahead

* Wednesday - Finish up the data plane / start on the control plane
   * Start to read Chapter 5
* Next Monday - Control plane
* Sunday, October 12th - Coding Project 1 - Part 2 is due
* Monday, October 13th - Mid-Term Exam review (will be recorded)
* Wednesday, October 15th - Mid-Term Exam (in class)
