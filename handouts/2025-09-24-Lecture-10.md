# Lecture 10 - Data Plane - Part 1

## Overview

At the start of the lecture, we will do a brief discussion about UDP and where / when we should use UDP versus TCP as well as some of the drawbacks / benefits of using the two different approaches.  From there, we will then pivot into the Data Plane with a focus on the Network Layer (Layer 3) and specifically forwarding, the act of sending packets onto their destination.  This is in contrast to the Control Plane which governs the protocols on how the forwarding information is distributed / populated.

## Readings - Lecture 10
