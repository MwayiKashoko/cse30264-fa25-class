# Lecture 13 - SDN + Control Plane

## Overview

In the last lecture, we walked through almost all of the data plane material with the exception of the content on Software Defined Networking (SDN).  In this lecture, we will wrap up the data plane of SDN and then pivot into the control plane, namely how the forwarding table gets populated.  We will look at broad classes of routing protocols as well as various mechanisms by which we can try to troubleshoot the network.

## Readings

* Chapter 4 - Kurose / Ross - Data Plane
* Chapter 5 - Kurose / Ross - Control Plane

## Key Points

* Data Plane
   * What is SDN? What makes it “different”?
* Control Plane
   * What is routing? What purpose does it serve?
   * Compare / contrast: link state, distance vector.
   * Compare / contrast: AS, OSPF, BGP.

## Looking Ahead

* Coding Project 1 - Part 2
   * Due Sunday, 10/12
   * Aim to have the core UDP aspects working by Wednesday's lecture
* Mid-Term Exam
   * Review - 10/13, Exam - 10/15
