# Lecture 14 - Control Plane Plus

## Overview

In today's lecture, we will continue on with the control plane possibly finishing up the control plane content.  In particular, we will start with distance vector routing and then go into the actual overarching intra / inter-domain routing protocols (OSPF, BGP).  We will then pivot into lower level tools (ping, traceroute, snmpwalk) and as time allows, start working through DNS.

## Readings - Lecture 15

* Chapter 5 - Kurose / Ross - Control Plane
* Chapter 6 - Kurose / Ross

## Handouts

* This Overview

## Prompt

Using either your phone or your laptop, determine the following pieces of information: IP address, router, DNS server, subnet. Compare / contrast that with your neighbor

## Key Points - In-Class - Lecture 15

* Compare / contrast: link state, distance vector.
* Compare / contrast: AS, OSPF, BGP.
* Define the following: ingress, egress, traffic engineering
* Define the following w/respect to BGP: speaker, peer, session, eBGP, iBGP, NLRI, thrashing
* Compare / contrast: ICMP, ping, trace route, SNMP
